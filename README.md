The following notebook is an end to end process of scraping product (Ipad4) information from Ebay and saving it in a MySQL table to conduct data wranglings and manipulations. It has the following steps:

1)Storing sponsored item and non-sponsored item url links for Ipad4 for the first 10 pages on Ebay as 2 separate txt files

2)For both sponsored and non-sponsored items, downloading every item page as a htm file in respective folders

3)Scraping different metrics for each item for both sponsored and non-sponsored types

4)Creating MySQL database and tables for sponsored and non-sponsored items

5)Analysing this data to identify the types of sellers who advertise/sponsor 'Ipad4' on Ebay
